- Diet's main UI improperly adds the decals, and it can't be fixed since there's no asset file for it
- LaserIO's selected tab button uses the default minecraft colour instead of Stoneborn. I can't fix it since it's using colour fill, but hopefully the UEL version is able to do so (I filed an issue report about it: https://github.com/LaserIO-UEL/LaserIO-UEL/issues/105)
- Railcraft Reborn's metal rolling JEI tab has all the slots quite offset. This is due to the JEI tab copying the machine's UI rather than being a separate file (I reported it though, so hopefully it gets fixed: https://github.com/railcraft-reborn/railcraft/issues/307)
