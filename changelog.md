A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stoneborn-modded-compatibility).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support, and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch (as well as version ports so you can quickly navigate on Modrinth).

Lines appended with a version in brackets (e.g. [1.20] Text Here) denote changes that only apply to that version.
--------------------------------------------------

## v3.2

*Ported & updated by [vizthex](https://www.curseforge.com/members/vizthex/projects).*

*Due to the sheer volume of mods this supports (most of which I've never even heard of), I probably missed a few mods that need updating. Please let us know in the comments or on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/StonebornModdedCompat/issues) and we'll fix it.*
